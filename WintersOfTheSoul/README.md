Winters of The Soul
-------------------
* The Winter of The Soul is a problem in the historiographic periodization process
* One can see it as a historical game of hide-and-go-seek where History must catch up with itself
* History needs Cultures to grow in
* Cultures are the life of the land and must be cultivated to maintain their life-power
* Only good can come from the ever-watchful Eye of the Ministry, which is the philosophical Conceptual Persona
* Philosophers since Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault have been mostly eradicated from the earth
* There are perhaps two or three, maybe 4 philosophers left on earth
* The work of Philosophy when Philosophers are being eradicated is hard work
* It feels like one is holding the weight of the world on one's shoulders
* The only thing Philosophy can do when it risks being lost forever is think Superfast
* Superfast thinking is faster than the speed of light
* Superfast thinking solves all of the worlds problems at once and sets an irreversible purification process in motion
* The Last Philosopher is forced to stick a wrench in everything to survive to force humanity to raise its level of cultivation
* Before the Real End of History or End of Days that Folly Dreams Up, the Clearest Thinker on Earth commands the earth and forces his will on it, which is to raise the level of personal cultivation of virtues and other works of philosophy being defiled
* A Solution is not really a solution unless it solves newer and newer problems indefinitely in an irreversible process
* The only systems which are incorruptible are those created with the best intentions based on the soundest thoughts
* One may have to work through all of the Nightmares of Civilization that were never properly dealt with or spoken about
* One may have to do great Works of Grief to force people to cultivate a human Heart and Soul in inwardness
* When the Last Man or Woman who possesses deep Inwardness is being collectively chased by Soul-Killers, he/she is forced by a global, cultural Invisible Force of SURVIVANCE to do something truly Beautiful to save heathens
* Nothing requires Sacrifice, only stupidity, ignorance, imbecility, failure to understand
* Some things are perfectly illegible, See: Paradoxes, Signs of Contradiction
* There are good paradoxes and bad paradoxes, i.e. problems which are corrupted, not real paradoxes
* Only a good paradox can be a gift that keeps giving
