Antisynthesis => NoiseField => Geomancia =>
===========================================

GEOMANCIA. Rationale to come, please stay tuned.
This was the first computer program I ever wrote, from start to finish, entirely on my own with no assistance whatsoever.
I had to do all the math myself to make sure everything worked out. I was able to do actual medieval-style Geomancy readings with this simple script.
I chose this project on purpose for so many valid reasons, it almost scares me to ponder how truly wonderful the experience was.
I do not promote magic or mysticism, I did it entirely as an intellectual exercise, a kind of "Trivial Pursuit".
For that reason, I am sharing the source code, but want it to be A.G. (c) 2011-2014 for now.
I hope that you can understand. It is dangerous to play with such things, history, symbolism, etc.
It should be treated as though it were a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe or Solitaire.
